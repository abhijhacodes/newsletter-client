- On the [home page](https://abhijha-newsletter.netlify.app/) any user can subscribe to my newsletter
- `/admin/publish` page is a private page which only admin can access using the login credentials
- From that page I need to enter newsletter title and body and it will send that as an email to all the subscribers
- Body of newsletter is HTML, used HTML instead of markdown so that I can easily add styles to the body and create it as a page to send in email
